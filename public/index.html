                        <p>Extensive experience on the use of Jquery as utility library and lately complementing usually complemented with Underscorejs.</p>
                        <p>Generally I create interactions optimized for smoothness and low power consumption, relying as much as I can in CSS transitions and animations, and simple maintainable JS code.</p>
                        <p>I don't consider Javascript a toy language and I'm pretty aware of the bad habits usually linked to this language. I keep Cockford's <em>Javascript: The Good Parts</em> close to my bedhead and currently I'm getting deepinto learning good Javascript Patterns.</p>
                        <p>I have been using in production environments AngularJS and Knockoutjs in order to give the usersresponsive web applications.I also have used Backbone during the exploratory weeks prior to the selection of AngularJS as mainfrontend framework.Plenty of experience using third party APIs, Plugins and Widgets.</p>

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    During my years as all round developer I was in charge of design as well and I learnt all the principles of
                    good design, composition and readability.
                    I'm really good at designing flows and thinking using time as the 4th dimension, being able to spot
                    problematic scenarios and design solutions for them in an interaction flow.
                    I have some experience with Adobe products as Photoshop, Illustrator and Fireworks, but as an Open
                    Source supporter I've been using most of the time the Gimp and Inkscape.
                    I'm extremely proficient with Inkscape and I use it as a tool to create wireframes, mockups, prototypes,
                    custom font sprites and SVGs to use in the web.
                    Usability and User Experience are extremely important having always the need to make something as easy
                    and delightful to use as possible.
                    I've been always quite interested on art and design and I have been a drawing aficionado for more than 20
                    years.

                    <h3>Rails</h3>
                    I spent my first working years as an all round Ruby on Rails developer mainly creating custom CMS and
                    internal web applications for small organizations using MySQL as database solution for all my projects.
                    Once I decided to specialize as a Frontend Developer I kept using RoR but stopped using databases and
                    used external APIs instead.

                I'm extremely creative. I've a high capability to solve problems by thinking outside of the box, and doing
                things as solving or minimizing problems in the Backend by using some interaction technique in the
                Frontend.
                Drawing has been my hobby since I was a child, and I always like to have a pencil, an eraser and paper at hand, I'm able to make pretty decent drawings and I'm really efficient at creating mocks on paper or awhiteboard.I'm a little bit too addicted to meetups for my own good, you can often find me at Javascript, Ruby,design or user experience Amsterdam Meetups.
