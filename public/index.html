                        <h3>Javascript</h3>
                        <p>I don't consider Javascript a toy language and I'm pretty aware of the bad habits usually related to this language. I try to follow Cockford's Javascript: The Good Parts advise and good Javascript Patterns. I would need a little push to use JSlint but I would be really glad to get to a company that encourages it.</p>                        
                        <p>I have extensive experience using Jquery as utility library complementing it when necessary with other libraries like UnderscoreJS</p>
                        <p>In the last two years I have been working in production environments with AngularJS, KnockoutJS and SpineJS. I've been also done some mockups with Backbone</p>
                        <p>Generally I create interactions optimized for smoothness and low power consumption, relying as much as I can in CSS transitions and animations, so I can keep Interaction, presentation and content layers separated.</p>
                        <p>Programming with Coffescript is not a problem to me, though I'm a bigger fan of Vainilla Javascript</p>
                        <p>I've some experiences with Yeoman (Grunt+Bower+YO) but just at the exploring level and I would be really interested on using it on production environments</p>
                        <p>Videogame programming is one of my hobbies and lately I have been exploring several HTML5/JS game engines and frameworks such as Phaser, ImpactJS or EaselJS; that has been quite useful to learn new ways of structuring the code and to note that they could be easily used as webapps development engines.</p>

                        <h3>HTML <em>&</em> CSS</h3>
                        <p>I'm pretty good & fast at writing clean, efficient, and semantically correct HTML & CSS.</p>
                        <p>I always apply graceful degradation philosophy to my works, due to my extensive experience I almost unconsciously apply styling patterns that result in posterior little or no crossbrowser debugging.</p>
                        <p>I have quite a good understanding of the pros and cons of SMACSS/Object Oriented CSS and have plenty of experience using (and customising) them in production environments.</p>
                        <p>I have experience with both SCSS and LESS and I'm pretty aware of the best practices to make them turn into a clean and efficient compiled CSS.</p>

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>At the beggining of my career as an all round developer I learnt the principles of good design, composition and readability.</p>

                        <p>I understand color theory in a way that I'm not only able to create or find good color schemes but I'm also able to parametrically generate color schemes which have a good contrast and doesn't look bad</p>

                        <p>I'm really good at designing flows and thinking using time as another dimension to have into account, being able to spot problematic scenarios and design solutions for them in any interaction flow.</p>

                        <p>I have some experience with Adobe products as Photoshop, Illustrator and Fireworks, but as an Open Source supporter I use most of the time the Gimp and Inkscape.</p>

                        <p>I'm extremely proficient with Inkscape and I use it as a tool to create wireframes, mockups, prototypes, custom font sprites and SVGs to use in the web.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since I was a child I've been interested in art and design and drawing has been one of my hobbies for more than 20 years.</p>

                        <p>Usability and User Experience are extremely important to me. I have the need to make everything as easy and delightful to use as possible. That's why  I have invested my share of time studiying a bit of psycology and Usability/UX </p>

                        <h3>Backend with RoR</h3>
                        <p>I started to get into web development as a Ruby on Rails developer, working mainly in creating custom CMS and internal webtooling to manage small organizations</p>
                        <p>At the very beggining I would use Rails with MySQL and the basic templating system to create my websites.</p>
                        <p>As time went by and I began to participate on bigger teams with Java backends I would use Rails to create APIs for my client side applications which would use Solar, MySQL and mainly another API as data origins</p>
                        <p>Influenced by the Ruby community I've started to do TDD several times, though sadly I've never gotten deep into it.</p>
